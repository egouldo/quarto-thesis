# University of Melbourne Thesis Template

This is a Quarto template that assists you in creating a University of Melbourne thesis. Either fork or download the repository to get started. This repository has been minimally altered from 
the [Monash Quarto Template](https://github.com/numbats/monash-quarto-thesis) by Rob J. Hyndman.
